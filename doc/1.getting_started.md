What is meta-debian?
====================

meta-debian is a set of recipes (metadata) for the poky build system,
which allows cross-building GNU/Linux images using Debian source packages.
By enabling meta-debian, you can cross-build a small GNU/Linux image
with Debian sources for multiple architectures.

The main purpose of meta-debian is to provide reference Linux distribution
for embedded systems satisfying the following needs.

* Long-term support
* Stability
* Wide embedded CPU support
* Customizability

Currently, the following software versions are supported in meta-debian.

* Source code: Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)
* Build system: Yocto Project (master)

Quick Start
===========

Install essential packages poky requires into your host system according to
<https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/latest/ref-manual/ref-manual.html#required-packages-for-the-build-host>

```sh
sudo apt-get install gawk wget git-core diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib \
build-essential chrpath socat cpio python python3 python3-pip python3-pexpect \
xz-utils debianutils iputils-ping
```

Setup repositories.

```sh
git clone -b master git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky.git
cd poky
git clone -b master https://github.com/meta-debian/meta-debian.git
cd ..
```

Setup build directory.

```sh
export TEMPLATECONF=meta-debian/conf
source ./poky/oe-init-build-env
```

You can change the target machine by setting `MACHINE` variable
in `conf/local.conf` to one of the following machines.

* qemux86 (default)
* qemux86-64
* qemuarm
* qemuarm64
* qemuppc
* qemumips

For example, the target machine is set to QEMU ARM by adding
the following difinition to `conf/local.conf`.

```
MACHINE = "qemuarm"
```

Now, the build system is ready.
Build Linux kernel and the minimal rootfs by the following command.
It takes a while to complete (more than 30 minutes).

```sh
bitbake core-image-minimal
```

Run the built Linux on QEMU.
Please replace `${MACHINE}` by the target machine
you selected in the above step.
NOTE: Confirm that the tun module, which runqemu depends on,
is correctly loaded in your system.

```sh
runqemu ${MACHINE} nographic
```

After boot, you can login as `root` without password.

If you'd like to reduce the time of bitbake,
please refer to <https://github.com/meta-debian/meta-debian-docker>.
